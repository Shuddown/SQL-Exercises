REM: Running PIZZA_DB.sql

@D:\Programming\SQL\Ex-3\Pizza_DB.sql

REM: 1. An user is interested to have list of pizzaâ€™s in the range of Rs.200-250. Create a view Pizza_200_250 which keeps the pizza details that has the price in the range of 200 to 250.

CREATE VIEW Pizza_200_250 AS
SELECT * FROM pizza
WHERE UNIT_PRICE BETWEEN 200 and 250;

SELECT * FROM Pizza_200_250

REM: This view is updateable as the query is simple, it contains no aggregate functions, group by functions and doesn't have any subqueries or joins, all the info also comes from the same table.

REM: 2. Pizza company owner is interested to know the number of pizza types ordered in each order.  Create a view Pizza_Type_Order that lists the number of pizza types ordered in each order.

CREATE VIEW Pizza_type_order AS
SELECT o.order_no, COUNT(ol.pizza_id)
FROM orders o
JOIN order_list ol
ON ol.ORDER_NO = o.ORDER_NO
GROUP_BY o.order_no;

SELECT * FROM Pizza_type_order;


REM: This view is not updateable as it contains an aggregate function, and relies on data from more than one table.

REM: 3. To know about the customers of Spanish pizza, create a view Spanish_Customers that list out the customer id, name, order_no of customers who ordered Spanish type

CREATE VIEW Spanish_Customers AS
SELECT c.cust_id, c.cust_name, o.order_no
FROM customer c
JOIN orders o
ON o.CUST_ID = c.CUST_ID
JOIN ORDER_LIST ol
ON ol.ORDER_NO = o.ORDER_NO
WHERE ol.PIZZA_ID = (
    SELECT PIZZA_ID
    FROM PIZZA
    WHERE PIZZA_TYPE = "spanish"
);

SELECT * FROM Spanish_Customers

REM: This view is not updateable as it relies on data from more than one table, and contains joins as well as subqueries.
